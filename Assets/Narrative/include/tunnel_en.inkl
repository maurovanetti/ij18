Vile rats! On the run again! # kidsmove
I'm not going to follow them through those pipes and I won't let my squad get trapped in there!
There are still {soldiers} of us and I want us to reach the end of the mission as one.
*   /Follow the lane[.] right next to it.
*   /Send one soldier on a scouting mission[.] into the tunnel.

        - Events has turret:
            I don't trust you.
            The last time I did, an unmanned turret fired at us.
            /As you wish, in this case you need to follow the lane on the right.
        - else:
            Um.
            (Voices.)
            I've sent a soldier. Let's wait. # longbreak
            Listen, she did not come back!
            No clue what happened to her, but it looks dangerous to send another one to check.
            /She'll be backâ€¦
            We are short of time. I leave a flare gun here, so that we can know if and when she's back.
            ~ soldiers--
            /In this case, you {soldiers} should continue along the lane.
    }
- There is no lane!
*   /Right next to it[.], look better.
- Found it.
